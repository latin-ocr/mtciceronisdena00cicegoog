ln the selection of atext, the editor
has adopted for his guides the editions of
Daris and Orelli, believing them to be,
on the whole, the best for his purpose.
Wherever they have differed he has
followed the reading generally sustained
by other good authorities.

The Notes have been prepared, as in
the ten preceding volumes os this series,
sor the illustration of difficolt passages
which occur in the text, and are, for
the most part, translations from a mass
. of Latin commentarios on the writings
of Cicero. To the learned scholar, they
will convey no new information3 but it
is hoped they will not be without profit
to the students in our eollegesâ€š and to

the general reader of the elassics.
